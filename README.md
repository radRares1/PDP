# PDP
 parallel and distributed programming done in java

lab1 - non cooperative multithreading on shared data<br />
lab2 - producer-consumer problem<br />
lab3 - dividing a simple task with no cooperation, using base thread implementation and thread pools<br />
lab4 - http protocol parser implemented synchronous only with socket callbacks and asynchronous, still using the callbacks but with c# task mechanism and async/await mechanism<br />
lab5 - parallelizing techniques, compute the multiplication of two polynomials of arbitrary degree with the normal schoolbook method and with karatsuba method, both sequential and parallel version and compare them <br />
lab6 - find a hamiltonean cycle in a directed graph using threads, document the performance <br />

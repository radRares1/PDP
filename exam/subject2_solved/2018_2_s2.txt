the problem here is that our flag hasValue is not safe from being modified by other threads
which will produce inconsistencies in the result. 
The solution is to add a syncronization mechanism to the hasValue variable,
either add a mutex and lock it around the hasValue in set function
either make hasValue atomic<bool>

the concurrency issue is again that the hasValue is not synchronized in set 
add a mutex at first line in set and lock it.


the function we need locks the mutex,
waits until the hasValue is set to true
then returns the completed value

T getValue() const
    {
        unique_lock<mutex> lck(mtx);
        cv.wait(lck, () {return hasValue; });
        return val;
    }
